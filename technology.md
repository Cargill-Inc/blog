  <p class="intro">We're focusing on a <b>new way to work</b>. <br><br>This helps ground Engineering on capabilities needed to solve business problems - with technology as the catalyst to being an asset and not just a cost center. In many cases, this results in shifting technology delivery towards an empowering work-flow that is customer focused; moving away from a platform-centric approach. The latter generally revolving around a prescriptive & rigid approach of incumbent tools - that shift is because we realize those tools and behaviors are anchors.</p>
